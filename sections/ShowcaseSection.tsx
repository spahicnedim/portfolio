                A custom-built web application designed to streamline the
                organization and execution of municipal council sessions. The
                system enables administrators to initiate structured debates for
                each agenda item, while participants can register to speak using
                formal categories such as discussion, clarification, response,
                and procedural violation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Built with modern technologies including Next.js, Appwrite, and
                TailwindCSS, the platform supports real-time updates, role-based
                permissions, and dynamic speaking time limits per municipality.
                This ensures sessions are conducted transparently and in full
                compliance with local regulations. <br />
                This project is built purposefully for municipalities in Bosnia
                and Herzegovina. <br />
